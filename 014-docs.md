# 014 - Documentation

Documentation is one of the most important parts of Yii.

## Package documentation

Documentation for a package could either be in `README.md` or `docs/{language}` where `{language}` is language code.
Usually `docs` is there if the package usage or configuration is not trivial or there's a need for translation.
